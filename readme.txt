Gives feedback to authors about the accessibility problems of their posts and pages.

== Description ==

The Accessible Helper plugin helps content authors understand what accessibility problems exist on a page, and what they can do to fix those errors. It keeps track in metdata of posts how many errors exist for that post, and can show a list of all errors, or a highlighted version of the post with errors outlined and prefixed with help icons.

== Installation ==

The plugin requires the open-source QUAIL (QUAIL Accessibility Information Library) before it can be enabled. To download the library go to http://quail-lib.org and download the latest release.

1. Upload the `accessible_helper` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Unpack the QUAIL library, and rename the directory to `quail`, instead of `quail-lib-x.x.x`
3. Upload the `quail` directory to `/wp-content/plugins/accessible_helper/`
3. Go to the Plugins page and enable the plugin

== Screenshots ==
1. The accessibility overview widget while editing a post or page
2. When the user hovers over an image before errors, they see a popup of what the problem is. This also links to a page with the same information.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How are the guidelines created? =

The guidelines are inherited from the QUAIL library. You can view all the tests that QUAIL provides, along with their alignment to each guideline at http://quail-lib.org/tests. 

= What are the severity levels all about? =

Tests are broken into three levels -- called severity levels -- that define how accurate a test is, and therefore, how severe errors the test finds are. They are really a level of how sure we are that there is a problem on a page. All accessibility errors should be fixed, but some things are not possible to test through automated processes alone (like if an "alt" text of an image is correct.)

1. **Severe errors** - Errors where there is a 100% certainty that the problem exists.
2. **Moderate errors** - There is probably an issue here, but someone should take a look first.
3. **Suggestions** - This area of the document has a likelihood that there could be an error, but only a human can review this.
